### Security and Risk Management

- Defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations.
- Organizations can reduce risks to critical assets and data.
- Risk mitigation means having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk.
- Compliance is the primary method used to develop an organization's internal security policies and regulatory requirements.
- Business continuity relates to an organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.
- **Security posture**: an organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change.
- **Information security** is also related to this domain and refers to a set of processes established to secure information.
- An organization may use playbooks and implement training as a part of their security and risk management program.

### Asset Security

- Is focused on securing digital and physical assets.
- It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.
- Knowing what data you have and who has access to it is necessary.
- Creating backups to ensure they are able to restore the environment if a security incident places the organizationâ€™s data at risk.

### Security Architecture and Engineering

- Is focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data.
- **Shared responsibility** means that all individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security.

### Communication and Network Security

- Is mainly focused on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.
- Secure networks keep an organization's data and communications safe.

### Identity and Access Management

- It's focused on access and authorization to keep data secure by making sure users follow established policies to control and manage assets.
- Ensuring user access is limited to what employees need.
- **Identification** is when a user verifies who they are by providing a user name, an access card
- **Authentication** is the verification process to prove a person's identity, such as entering a password or PIN
- **Authorization** takes place after a user's identity has been confirmed and relates to their level of access, which depends on the role in the organization.
- **Accountability** refers to monitoring and recording user actions, like login attempts, to prove systems and data are used properly.

### Security Assessment and Testing

- This domain focuses on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
- Can help an organization identify new and better ways to mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
- Use security control testing evaluations and security assessment reports to improve existing controls or implement new controls.

### Security Operations

- Is focused on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.
- Investigations begin once a security incident has been identified.
- A digital forensic investigation must take place to identify when, how, and why the breach occurred.

### Software Development Security

- This domain focuses on using secure coding practices.
- Secure coding practices are recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.
- Security must be incorporated into each element of the software development life cycle, from design and development to testing and release.
- Security cannot be an afterthought.
- Performing a secure design review during the design phase, secure code reviews during the development and pentest during the deployment.

## Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

- An **asset** is an item perceived as having value to an organization.
- A **threat** is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.
- A **risk** is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. The likelihood of a threat occurring.
- A **vulnerability** is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat.
- Security involves protecting organizations and people from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
- Understanding the current threat landscapes gives organizations the ability to create policies and processes designed to help prevent and mitigate these types of security issues.

### NIST Risk Management Framework

1. Prepare: refers to activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs.
2. Categorize:  is used to develop risk management processes and tasks.
3. Select: choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization.
4. Implement: security and privacy plans for the organization.
5. Assess: determine if established controls are implemented correctly.
6. Authorize: being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization.
7. Monitor: be aware of how systems are operating.

## Frameworks and Controls

## Frameworks

- Organizations use security frameworks as a starting point to create their own security policies and processes.
- **Security frameworks** are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
- People are the biggest threat to security.
- Frameworks can be used to create plans that increase employee awareness and educate them.

## Security controls

- Controls are used to reduce specific risks.
- Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.
- Controls are used alongside frameworks to reduce the possibility and impact of a security threat.
- Controls can be physical, technical, and administrative.
- Controls are typically used to prevent, detect, or correct security issues.
- **Physical controls**: Gates, fences, locks, security guards, CCTV, surveillance cameras, and motion detectors.
- **Technical controls**: Firewall, MFA and antivirus.
- **Administrative controls**: separation of duties, authorization and asset classification.
- Encryption is the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format.
- Authentication is the process of verifying who someone or something is.
- Authorization refers to the concept of granting access to specific resources within a system.

## The CIA triad

- Model for managing security risks, helps organizations consider risks when setting up systems and security policies.
- **Confidentiality**: Only authorized users access specific data (achieved through least privilege principle).
- **Integrity**: Data is verifiably correct, authentic, and reliable (ensured through cryptography and encryption).
- **Availability**: Authorized users can access data when needed (e.g., remote access to internal network with limited permissions).
- Establishes a strong security posture.
- Improves understanding of how security teams protect organizations.

## NIST frameworks

- Organizations use frameworks as a starting point to develop plans that mitigate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
- Frameworks are created by organizations to assist security professionals in developing effective security plans.
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides frameworks to support ongoing security efforts for all types of organizations.

### NIST CSF

- Is a voluntary framework consisting of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.
- Essential for maintaining security.
- Consists of five core functions:
  + **Identify**: Managing cybersecurity risks and their impact on people and assets. A security analyst monitors internal networks for potential security issues.
  + **Protect**: Implementing policies, procedures, training, and tools to mitigate threats. ecurity teams implement policies, procedures, training, and tools to mitigate threats.
  + **Detect**: Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities. A security analyst reviews a new security tool to ensure proper flagging of security incidents.
  + **Respond**: Containing, neutralizing, analyzing incidents, and implementing improvements. A security team works together to contain, neutralize, analyze incidents, and improve security processes.
  + **Recover**: Returning affected systems back to normal operation. A security team restores systems, data, and assets affected by incidents.

## OWASP

- Security Principles:
  + Help cybersecurity analysts reduce risk for an organization.
  + **Minimize attack surface area**: Reduce potential vulnerabilities.
  + **Principle of least privilege**: Give users only the access they need.
  + **Defense in depth**: Have multiple security controls in place.
  + **Separation of duties**: Require multiple people for critical actions.
  + **Keep security simple**: Avoid overly complex security solutions.
  + **Fix security issues correctly**: Address the root cause of incidents.
  + **Establish secure defaults**: Make security the default state.
  + **Fail securely**: When controls fail, default to the most secure option.
  + **Don't trust services**: Verify security of third-party partners.
  + **Avoid security by obscurity**: Don't rely on hiding information for security.

## Security Audits

- Improve an organization's security posture.
- Help organizations avoid compliance fines.
- Identify organizational risks.
- Assess security controls.
- Correct compliance issues.
- Internal and external.
- Reviews of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against internal and external criteria.
- Internal criteria: Policies, procedures, and best practices.
- External criteria: Regulatory compliance, laws, and federal regulations.
- Help maintain an organization's security posture and identify areas for remediation.
- Frameworks (e.g., NIST CSF, ISO 27000) help organizations prepare for audits.
- Adherence to frameworks saves time during audits.
- Frameworks and controls help align with compliance requirements.
- [Control categories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ut_H5A9FHwuQEy6_qG6Lfy3zwF6GSJnj3DZTMaNRWEE/template/preview?resourcekey=0-i4dR5qZFqQyfzr8uk3OOmA)
- [Assessment & Auditing Resources](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/assessment-auditing-resources)
  
- Planning process:
  + Establishing Scope: Identify relevant people, assets, policies, procedures, and technologies. (e.g., user permissions, existing controls, current technology).
  + Defining Goals: Outline security objectives to achieve (e.g., implementing core security frameworks, establishing compliance policies, strengthening system controls).
  + Risk Assessment (conducted by managers/stakeholders): Identify potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. (e.g., inadequate controls for physical/digital assets, unsecured data storage, weak access controls for internal network).
  + Controls Assessment: Evaluate the effectiveness of implemented security controls.
  + Compliance Assessment: Verify adherence to relevant regulations.
    
- Internal security audit:
  + Review Key Documents: Before diving into the final stages, revisit the established scope (focus areas of the audit), goals (objectives to improve security), and the completed risk assessment (identification of potential threats and vulnerabilities).
  + Ask Critical Questions: Analyze these documents to understand the audit's purpose, the most at-risk assets, and the effectiveness of current controls in protecting those assets.
  + Identifying Security Gaps: Audits are crucial for uncovering weaknesses in an organization's security strategy. The
  + Improved Security Posture: By identifying and addressing security shortcomings, organizations can significantly strengthen their overall security posture.
  + Data-Driven Decision Making: Audits provide valuable insights that can inform security decision-making.
    
- Control Assessment:
  + Administrative Controls: Focus on the human element. These are policies and procedures that define data management practices, such as password complexity requirements.
  + Technical Controls: Involve hardware and software solutions to safeguard assets. Examples include intrusion detection systems (IDS) and data encryption.
  + Physical Controls: Implement measures to prevent physical access to critical assets. This might involve surveillance cameras, access control systems, and locks.
  + Evaluating Control Effectiveness: Assess how well these controls mitigate the identified risks from the risk assessment.
 
- Compliance Assessment:
  + Understanding Compliance Regulations: Remember, these are legal requirements organizations must follow to ensure the security of private data.
  + Verification Process: In this step, you'll determine if the organization adheres to the necessary compliance regulations. The text mentions an example where the organization operates in the EU and accepts credit card payments.

- Communication: Delivering the Findings
  + Audience: Once the audit is complete, you'll need to communicate the results and recommendations to relevant stakeholders within the organization.
  + Content of Communication: This report typically summarizes the audit's scope and goals, followed by a clear outline of the identified security risks.
