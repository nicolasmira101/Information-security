### Security and Risk Management

- Defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations.
- Organizations can reduce risks to critical assets and data.
- Risk mitigation means having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk.
- Compliance is the primary method used to develop an organization's internal security policies and regulatory requirements.
- Business continuity relates to an organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.
- **Security posture**: an organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change.
- **Information security** is also related to this domain and refers to a set of processes established to secure information.
- An organization may use playbooks and implement training as a part of their security and risk management program.

### Asset Security

- Is focused on securing digital and physical assets.
- It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.
- Knowing what data you have and who has access to it is necessary.
- Creating backups to ensure they are able to restore the environment if a security incident places the organizationâ€™s data at risk.

### Security Architecture and Engineering

- Is focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data.
- **Shared responsibility** means that all individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security.

### Communication and Network Security

- Is mainly focused on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.
- Secure networks keep an organization's data and communications safe.

### Identity and Access Management

- It's focused on access and authorization to keep data secure by making sure users follow established policies to control and manage assets.
- Ensuring user access is limited to what employees need.
- **Identification** is when a user verifies who they are by providing a user name, an access card
- **Authentication** is the verification process to prove a person's identity, such as entering a password or PIN
- **Authorization** takes place after a user's identity has been confirmed and relates to their level of access, which depends on the role in the organization.
- **Accountability** refers to monitoring and recording user actions, like login attempts, to prove systems and data are used properly.

### Security Assessment and Testing

- This domain focuses on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
- Can help an organization identify new and better ways to mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
- Use security control testing evaluations and security assessment reports to improve existing controls or implement new controls.

### Security Operations

- Is focused on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.
- Investigations begin once a security incident has been identified.
- A digital forensic investigation must take place to identify when, how, and why the breach occurred.

### Software Development Security

- This domain focuses on using secure coding practices.
- Secure coding practices are recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.
- Security must be incorporated into each element of the software development life cycle, from design and development to testing and release.
- Security cannot be an afterthought.
- Performing a secure design review during the design phase, secure code reviews during the development and pentest during the deployment.

## Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

- An **asset** is an item perceived as having value to an organization.
- A **threat** is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.
- A **risk** is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. The likelihood of a threat occurring.
- A **vulnerability** is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat.
- Security involves protecting organizations and people from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
- Understanding the current threat landscapes gives organizations the ability to create policies and processes designed to help prevent and mitigate these types of security issues.

### NIST Risk Management Framework

1. Prepare: refers to activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs.
2. Categorize:  is used to develop risk management processes and tasks.
3. Select: choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization.
4. Implement: security and privacy plans for the organization.
5. Assess: determine if established controls are implemented correctly.
6. Authorize: being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization.
7. Monitor: be aware of how systems are operating.

## Frameworks and Controls

## Frameworks

- Organizations use security frameworks as a starting point to create their own security policies and processes.
- **Security frameworks** are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
- People are the biggest threat to security.
- Frameworks can be used to create plans that increase employee awareness and educate them.

## Security controls
